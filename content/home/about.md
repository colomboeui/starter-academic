# About widget.
widget = "I am a PhD researcher at the European University Institute, where I study political behaviour. At the EUI I have been working under the supervision of prof. Elias Dinas. The topic I am mostly interested in and I am addressing in my research are:

- trust and social capital
- parties and voting behaviour
- social policy preferences

I also have a strong interest in quatitative methods. I love working both with observational and experimental data."  # See https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/page-builder/
